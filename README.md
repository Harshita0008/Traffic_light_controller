# Traffic_light_controller

## ABSTRACT:
Traffic light control systems are widely used to control and to monitor the transport
system. They are mainly used to maintain a smooth traffic system on the busiest roads
of the city. However, the synchronization of multiple traffic light systems at adjacent
intersections is a complicated problem.. We are approaching the concept of the volume
control traffic system. Here the traffic system is maintained based on the count of the
cars. The number of cars is to be counted by using the sensors. The two types of the
sensor are the touch line sensors and the laser sensor. The touch line sensors are
sensitive enough to count the number of cars but get easily damaged by heavy
vehicles. The laser sensors are used to detect the number of cars. They are preferred
due to their directivity property.

## Problem Statement:
The purpose of this project is to develop a series of systems models for
traffic passing through a 4-way intersection, controlled by traffic lights. We
will assume that the arrangement of traffic lights and road lanes is fixed and
that the lights switch from red to green to amber in a regular repetitive
pattern. Moreover, we assume that driver behavior is constrained by the
road rules (we keep this part really simple) and the desire to avoid vehicle
collisions.

## CONCLUSION:
In the Traffic Control Management System, the major function of a user defined header file is to
make the system capture the video of the traffic lanes and to analyze them. The caliberate.cpp
receives the analyzed data of running traffic and it takes the appropriate decision for traffic
control. The application detects traffic by using opencv. The algorithm provides necessary traffic
information required for analysis and decision making in traffic management. The major
information to be detected and analyzed for traffic management by this application are:
-Average movement of vehicles
-Percentage of area covered by vehicles on the road
This software analyses the traffic for each lane and decides to divide the traffic based on type of
vehicle. In order to reduce traffic congestion, the small vehicles are moved in one lane and
heavier vehicles are moved in the other.

## FUTURE SCOPE
Due to continuous growth of population in the world, it is a great challenge for the
upcoming generation to manage the traffic system. Much improvement will come in the
future.
To manage the conventional transport system we should think of an intelligent and
automatic way of controlling the system. As the population increases, it increases the
number of vehicles also. To control the huge number of vehicles, intelligent methods
should be adopted.
In the future we can use the image sensor or imager. It does it work by producing the
image of the roads. It creates the image by converting the variable attenuation of light
into a signal that conveys the picture. Imagers used both digital and analog electronics
devices.
